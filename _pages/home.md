## My Short Bio
I received my undergraduate degrees in mechanical engineering from the Sharif University of Technology in Tehran, Iran. I moved to Switzerland for my M.Sc. at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) and then joined the group of Prof. Berend Smit at EPFL for my Ph.D. in chemistry and chemical engineering. In 2019, I visited Prof. Kulik’s group at MIT on an SNSF fellowship award. I defended my Ph.D. in March 2020, which was awarded the best Ph.D. thesis in chemistry and chemical engineering of EPFL.  I obtained an SNSF postdoctoral fellowship to perform my independent research in Prof. Frank Noé's group, AI4Sciences, at Freie Universität Berlin, Germany. 

My research interests focus on computational and data-driven design and engineering of novel materials for energy-related applications. I aim to develop methods to enable an autonomous matter development for energy-related applications.
