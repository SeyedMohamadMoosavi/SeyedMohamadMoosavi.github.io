I am a postdoctoral researcher in Artificial Intelligence for Sciences group [(AI4Sciences)](https://www.mi.fu-berlin.de/en/math/groups/ai4s/index.html), at Freie Universität Berlin, Germany. My interdisciplinary research is focused on computational and data-driven design and engineering of novel materials. I am particularly excited to develop methods to enable autonomous matter development for energy-related applications.

I obtained my Ph.D. in chemistry and chemical engineering from [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), Switzerland, in the Laboratory for Molecular Simulation ([LSMO](https://lsmo.epfl.ch/)). My dissertation was [awarded the best Ph.D. thesis](https://mobile.twitter.com/smohmoosavi/status/1339604695740862464) in chemistry and chemical engineering of EPFL in 2020. In 2019, I visited Prof. Kulik’s group at [MIT](http://hjkgrp.mit.edu/) on an SNSF fellowship award. During COVID pandemic, I remotely collaborated with [EntosAI](https://www.entos.ai/) and [CalTech](https://millergroup.caltech.edu/Miller_Group/Home.html).

My research has been highlighted in Nature, Nature Communications, JACS, Chemical Sciences, ACS Central Science, and Chemical Reviews. You can find my publications on my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AS9Iz-kAAAAJ&hl=en) account.
