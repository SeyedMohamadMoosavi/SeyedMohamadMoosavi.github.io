## Hi, welcome!


I am a PostDoc in the group of Frank No√©, AI four Sciences, at FU-Berlin. My research aims at development of computational and data-driven methods to address challenges on the way to autonomous matter development for energy-related applications. Previously, I did my PhD with Berend Smit at EPFL, Switzerland, where I worked on the development and application of these methods in studying physical properties, as well as the synthesis of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). 


Where to find me in fall:
- EuroMOF2021 conference, talk September
- Chemistry as Innovative Science (CHAIN), invited talk, December
